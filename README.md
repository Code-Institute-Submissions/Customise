# Customise

Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

## Description

* Customise is a website development business website that lets the user contact customise so that customise can make them a website. The main theme of the website is that it is customisable. The website will have a dark and light mode which can be changed by the user of the website. It will also have a menu of 4 colours that when clicked change all the secondary colour styles on some of the buttons and certain headings and borders. The website will also have a form that the user can fill out and receive a message that me "the customise team " will be in touch. The website will also have a map that shows the user where customise is based and some of its hubs around the world. 

## What it does

* To create dark and light mode I will be creating a button that toggles from dark to light mode.

* I will create a button that onclick opens a navigation where you can choose a colour theme for the website.

* I will use the local storage API to remember how my website was customized

* I will use the google maps API to create my map and add clusters which show where customize is based

* I will use the mail.js API to allow the user to fill out the form and receive a confirmation email and notify me "the customise team" about their needs.

## How it will work 

* to create the dark to light mode feature I will add two CSS files that have different styles then using the link in my HTML and creating a JavaScript function based on the CSS style sheet link thats present I will onclick change the link URL from the light mode style sheet URL to my dark mode style sheet URL this will be updated to the local storage API so its remembered for next time. 

* to create my side nav color changer I will use the local storage to create an initial colour that all the buttons and other objects are styled with then using a loop I will access these classes and replace them with a new class that consists of new CSS changing the colour and also updating the local storage API.

* to connect my google maps API I will use the google maps CDN and connect it to my website then create my clusters and map style.

* to create my form I will use email.js and use their CDN to allow the user to receive a confirmation email that I received the information about their project

## UX

1. Project Goals

* The main goal for Customise.ie is to provide the user with a customisable website that shows off what customize are capable of doing while also allowing the user to contact the Customise team and also with the google map api the user can see where the companys many hubs are based. Also the website will be customisable with a dark and light mode feature and a side nav which can change the colour theme of many of the buttons and features throughout the website. most important these changes will be saved to the local storage so next time the custom set is remembered
