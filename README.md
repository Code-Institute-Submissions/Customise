# Customise

Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

## Description

* Customise is a website development business website that lets the user contact customise so that customise can make them a website. The main theme of the website is that it is quite customisable. The website will have a dark and light mode which can be changed by the user of the website. It will also have a side menu of 4 colours that when clicked change all the secondary colour styles on most of the buttons and certain headings. It will also have features where the content and structure of the website can be changed. The website will also have a form that the user can full out and receive a message that the me "the customise team " will be in touch. The website will also have a map that shows the user where customise is based. 

## What it does

* To create dark and light mode I will be creating a button that toggles from dark to light mode.

* I will create a side nav that has 4 buttons that change the colour of the buttons across the website and some of the headings and other small features 

* I will use the local storage API to remember how my website was customized

* I will have functional buttons across the website that allow the user to change some of the shapes on the website and some of the fonts.

* I will use the google maps API to create my map and add clusters which show where customize is based

* I will use the mail.js API to allow the user to fill out the form and receive a confirmation email and notify me "the customise team" about their needs.

## How it will work 

* to create the dark to light mode feature I will add two CSS files that have different styles then using the link in my HTML and creating a JavaScript function based on the CSS style sheet link thats present i will on click change the link URL from the light mode style sheet URL to my dark mode style sheet URL. 

* to create my side nav color changer I will use the local storage to create a initial colour that all the buttons and other objects are styled with then using a loop I will access these styles and replace them with a new style that consists of new CSS changing the colour and also updating the local storage API.

* to create my functional buttons across the website i will use more or less the same method of creating the colored buttons but on a smaller scale.  

* to connect my google maps API I will use the google maps CDN and connect it to my website then create my clusters

* to create my form I will use email.js and use their CDN to allow the user to receive a confirmation email that i received the information about their project
